# gogoanime-batch-downloader
A python script to download anime episodes in any quality from Gogoanime.

# Installation
Download the zip and extract it to a folder. Open a command prompt there and then `pip install -r requirements.txt` then `python gogo_downloader.py`.

# Usage
Enter the URL of the 1st episode of the anime you want to download then enter the starting episode number and ending episode number.
Then mention the quality which you want, if the mentioned quality is not found a lower quality will be selected.
If you want to download the video files enter 1 or if you only want the links of the videos enter 2.
The latter option is if you want to use another program such as IDM to download the videos (a .txt file will be generated).
You also need to mention an output file name and folder path.
